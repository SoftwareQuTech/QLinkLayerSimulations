# all simulation data files will have names that start with
# a timestamp, and all timestamps will start with "20" 
# (2018, 2019, 2020) so in order to prevent the (possibly huge
# amount of) simulation data to also be pushed to a remote 
# repository, we let git ignore these
20*

# all cached python files

# Config files
